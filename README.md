# FIPS Geocode Mapping

These provided JSON files are meant to answer the question, "For a given FIPS code, what is the basic information I need to plot this as a data point on a map?"
I wasn't able to find anything processed already like this, so I decided to create this to use.

Data provided by the [U.S. Census Gazetteer Files](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html).
## Getting Started

You can either use the JSON files `fips_map.json` or `fips_map_minify.json` directly (the latter being the "minified" version of the same data). Or you can run and modify the script yourself.

```
python script.py
```
